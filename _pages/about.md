My Abridged Life Story
----------------------

Hey! It's me, Billy. I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science (Class of 2021) and my mission is to help people. I was born in [Huangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan), which is in the Anhui province of China. I come from a family of doctors and medical professionals (my dad is an oncologist and my mom is the manager of a family medicine clinc. And my grandpa is a retired heart surgeon! No pressure.). For my 9th birthday, my father gifted me a thick book about [anatomy](https://www.amazon.ca/Human-Anatomy-Definitive-Visual-Guide/dp/1465419543). "Read it," he said, "Maybe you'll find something in yourself from that book." And thus from a young age I have always been armed with my confidence of joining my family's profession and a litany of facts about The Gallbladder. 

**Am you on the right page? Probably.**

I began college a pre-medicine student working as a [scribe for the family med clinic](https://github.com/billylin57/billylin57.github.io/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-11%20at%2012.28.19%20AM.png). I noticed the importance of a good network for keeping patient records updated. I recognized the difficulties of doctors who had to look through their scanned handwritten notes from decades before to refer back to. In short, I knew that I could help a lot more people by bettering the tools the doctors used. My first experience with this was creating electronic forms that when filled out, were automatically registered to the patient in the EMR database, eliminating the need to scan the previously physical file and then upload it manually to the right patient's electronic folder. This expedited and foolproofed the process, and soon all of the clinic doctors were asking me to make electronic versions of their forms so they could save time and see more patients. 

**What I am up to now.**

I started coding in the Summer of 2019 by enrolling in the infamous beginner Computer Science classes at UC Berkeley, a **big** pivot from the pre-medicine track I was on for my first half of college. Since then, I've made my own Version Control System called [**Gitlet**](https://github.com/billylin57/gitlet2) (Java), a Scandanavian board game called **Tablut** complete with **its own AI (Java)**, and analyzed the **food purchasing patterns of thousands of high schools** across the country using tools **Pandas and NumPy (Python) with [Dr. Kris Madsen](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/kristine-madsen/)** and the team from [Good Food Purchasing Program](https://goodfoodpurchasing.org). I know that I have much to learn in this field, but I deeply enjoy learning as much as I can and seeing the positive effects of what I can create. Public speaking and event organization are some of my other strengths - if you wish to see my full resume click [here!](https://github.com/billylin57/billylin57.github.io/blob/master/files/Billy%20Lin%20RESUME.pdf)

**Some less serious stuff!**

I enjoy writing stuff that I think is funny, [trivia (my grade 10 trivia team grinning in our silver medals](https://github.com/billylin57/billylin57.github.io/blob/master/images/trivia%20for%20website.jpg), [sitcoms](https://billylin57.github.io/portfolio/sitcoms/), jazz music through the ages, basketball, watching MMA, reading Wikipedia, playing card games, learning cool new tricks when coding, international relations, and public speaking. 





**Common Ground (if you want to read more about me!)**

The year is 2012. I am a sixth grader in elementary school. 

"Does anybody want to become a Peer Mediator?" my teacher asked the class of hyperactive pre-teens who were starting to gain a sense of authority from their elementary school seniority. 

Peer Mediators during Recess and Lunchtime act as supervisors and leaders in case there was any trouble, and I put my hand up tentatively. I had looked up to them back in my days of being a wee fourth grader. Mr. Gidinski saw my hand, and acknowledged me. Thankfully, the application process back then wasn't as stringent - I got the role after merely stating my intention to carry out the role seriously. (To any recruiters reading this, I am willing to make the same pledge. Swear!)

From my elementary school teachers, I learned that there were at least two sides to every conflict, and resolving the conflict requires understanding all sides of it. This is how I have learned about the importance of empathy and compromise: in the face of conflict at a dusty playground. However, the importance of what I learned was not lost.

A few years later in high school, I would use these same lessons to manage my ace Trivia team, create Resolutions in Model United Nations, and eventually create and manage our very own MUN conference. I would even use these skills when I was a swim instructor for kids - this child isn't biting me because he pines for human flesh or because he wishes to cause me unimaginable pain; rather, he is probably scared of the water and hesitant to get his hair wet. 

A few more years, and now I am in college. I am finding value in these lessons still. From being the Vice President of Recruitment of my fraternity, working collabortively on a massive analytical study on the ethics of American school lunches, stressing about school, and being the Vice President of Business Partnerships at Berkeley Model United Nations, there seems to be more adversity than ever before to manage and find common ground in. Even coding requires some empathy. 

"Put yourself in the place of a computer. How would this command make you feel? What would YOU do?"

Something tells me that this is how life is going to be: a constant struggle to find common ground with other parties to resolve conflicts of understanding. Thankfully, I've been preparing for it.
