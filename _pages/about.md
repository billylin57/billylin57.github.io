This is the website of a 20 year old college student who hopes that his code will make a difference in the world.

**Common Ground**

The year is 2012. I am a sixth grader in elementary school. 
"Does anybody want to become a Peer Mediator?" my teacher asked the class of hyperactive pre-teens who were starting to gain a sense of authority from their elementary school seniority. 
Peer Mediators during Recess and Lunchtime act as supervisors and leaders in case there was any trouble, and I put my hand up tentatively. I had looked up to them back in my days of being a wee fourth grader. Mr. Gidinski saw my hand, and acknowledged me. Thankfully, the application process back then wasn't as stringent - I got the role after merely stating my intention to carry out the role seriously. (To any recruiters reading this, I am willing to make the same pledge. Swear!)
From my elementary school teachers, I learned that there were at least two sides to every conflict, and resolving the conflict requires understanding all sides of it. This is how I have learned about the importance of empathy and compromise: in the face of conflict at a dusty playground. However, the importance of what I learned was not lost.
A few years later in high school, I would use these same lessons to manage my ace Trivia team, create Resolutions in Model United Nations, and eventually create and manage our very own MUN conference. I would even use these skills when I was a swim instructor for kids - this child isn't biting me because he wishes to cause me unimaginable pain; rather, he is probably scared of the water and hesitant to get his hair wet. 
A few more years, and now I am in college. I am finding value in these lessons still. From being the Vice President of Recruitment of my fraternity, stressing about school, and being the Vice President of Business Partnerships at Berkeley Model United Nations, there seems to be more adversity than ever before to manage and find common ground in. Even coding requires some empathy. 
"Put yourself in the place of a computer. How would this command make you feel? What would YOU do?"
Something tells me that this is how life is going to be: a constant struggle to find common ground with other parties to resolve conflicts of understanding. Thankfully, I've been preparing for it.
