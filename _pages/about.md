My Abridged Life Story
----------------------

Hey! It's me, Billy. I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science (Class of 2021) and my mission is to help people. I was born in [Huangshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangshan), which is in the Anhui province of China. I come from a family of doctors and medical professionals (my dad is an oncologist and my mom is the manager of a family medicine clinc. And my grandpa is a retired heart surgeon! No pressure.). For my 9th birthday, my father gifted me a thick book about [anatomy](https://www.amazon.ca/Human-Anatomy-Definitive-Visual-Guide/dp/1465419543). "Read it," he said, "Maybe you'll find something in yourself from that book." And thus from a young age I have always been armed with my confidence of joining my family's profession and a litany of facts about The Gallbladder. 

**Are you on the right page? Probably.**

I began college a pre-medicine student working as a [scribe for the family med clinic](https://github.com/billylin57/billylin57.github.io/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202020-04-11%20at%2012.28.19%20AM.png). I noticed the importance of a good network for keeping patient records updated. I recognized the difficulties of doctors who had to look through their scanned handwritten notes from decades before to refer back to. In short, **I knew that I could help more people by bettering the tools** that were used. Here are some of the tools I have created since then:

**Gitlet - Java, Git**

 • A working version of Git “Lite” with Java, which is a Version Control System with the basic commands of Git, such as Add, Commit, Branch, Checkout, Merge, and more. Uses SHA-1 encoding, file serialization and deserialization, and data structure algorithms.
 
**Predicting Housing Prices - Python**

 • Used Feature Engineering, One-Hot Encoding, and a Linear Regression model to predict sale prices based on predictors like total bathrooms, fireplace quality, garage area, and more. 
 
**RISC-V CPU - Logisim, RISC-V**

 • A working RISC-V pipelined CPU built entirely in Logisim, able to interpret >50 unique commands, including Load, Store, Branch, and Jump instructions.
